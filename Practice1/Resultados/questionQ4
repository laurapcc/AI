python3 pacman.py -l openMaze -p SearchAgent
With DFS on openMaze it tours horizontally around all the blocks that lead to the goal state.
In other words, it zig-zags horizontally till a solution is found.
********** Check if optimal (probably not) **********


python3 pacman.py -l openMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=bfs
With BFS it goes directly to the target traicing straight lines, first down, left, down and left again.
********** Check if optimal (it may be) **********


python3 pacman.py -l openMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=ucs
With UCS it does the same as BFS (pretty much).


python3 pacman.py -l openMaze -p SearchAgent -a fn=astar,heuristic=manhattanHeuristic
With AStar the same as the 2 before. Look into the red squares patterns.
